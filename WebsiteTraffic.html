        <h2>Device Type Analysis</h2>
        <img src="images/device-analysis.png" alt="Device Type Analysis">
        <p>Desktop users have the longest session duration and a moderate bounce rate, suggesting they are the most engaged users, meanwhile mobile users have shorter sessions and highest bounce rate, indicating potential usability issues or content misalignment for mobile visitors. Tablet users consistently show the lowest metrics across both measures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Page Duration Analysis</h2>
        <img src="images/page-duration.png" alt="Page Duration Analysis">
        <p>The Contact page leads with the highest average session duration (16.88 minutes), followed by Home (16.41), then Products (16.15). The small differences between these pages suggest consistently engaging content across main site sections, though the Contact page's longer duration might indicate users spending time filling out forms or searching for information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Country Traffic Trends</h2>
        <img src="images/country-trends.png" alt="Country Traffic Trends">
        <p>The broken up charts suggest that there are not enough data points in the small csv file to create a strong line chart displaying trends and traffic. However, it can be determined that there is typically a spike in traffic in the months between May and July, and dips between August and November, showing seasonality across the countries.</p>
