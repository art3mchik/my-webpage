        <h2>Device Type Analysis</h2>
        <img src="images/device-analysis.png" alt="Device Type Analysis">
        <p>Desktop users have the longest session duration and a moderate bounce rate, suggesting they are the most engaged users, meanwhile mobile users have shorter sessions and highest bounce rate, indicating potential usability issues or content misalignment for mobile visitors. Tablet users consistently show the lowest metrics across both measures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Page Duration Analysis</h2>
        <img src="images/page-duration.png" alt="Page Duration Analysis">
        <p>The Contact page leads with the highest average session duration (16.88 minutes), closely followed by Home (16.41) and Products (16.15). The small differences between these pages suggest consistently engaging content across main site sections, though the Contact page's longer duration might indicate users spending time filling out forms or searching for information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h2>Country Traffic Trends</h2>
        <img src="images/country-trends.png" alt="Country Traffic Trends">
        <p>Canada and Germany show the most volatile traffic patterns with significant peaks around May-June, while the UK maintains relatively stable traffic with a notable spike in June. All countries demonstrate some seasonality with generally higher traffic in the middle of the year (May-July), followed by a gradual decline towards the later months, suggesting potential opportunities for targeted campaigns during lower-traffic periods.</p>
