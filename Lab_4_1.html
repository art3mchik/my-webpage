    <div class="question">
        <h3>What insights can you draw about sales concentration in different regions of the United States?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The top 3 sales states are: CA, NY, TX</li>
            <li>The bottom 3 sales states are: ND, WV, SD</li>
            <li>The midwest shows low sales numbers whereas both West and East coast boast strong sales.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <img src="images/2.png" alt="Category Sales Chart">
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Which category has the highest sales, and which has the lowest? How does the performance of each category vary?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The technology category had the highest sales</li>
            <li>The office supplies category had the lowest sales</li>
            <li>The spread between office supplies and technology is vast, but the spread between each category to the next highest isn't so big.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <img src="images/3.png" alt="Monthly Sales Trend">
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Are there any noticeable patterns, such as peak sales months or consistent seasonal trends?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Peak sales months are November and December, clearly correlated to American consumerism during holiday season.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <img src="images/4.png" alt="Profit vs Sales Scatter Plot">
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Are there any sub-categories with high sales but low profit, or vice versa?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tables and bookcases are sub-categories with high sales but low/negative profit.</li>
            <li>This may be due to materials cost associated with production (wood).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <img src="images/5.png" alt="Sales by Shipping Mode">
    <div class="question">
        <h3>Which shipping mode generates the highest sales, and which generates the least?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard class is the highest used shipping mode whereas same day is the least</li>
            <li>This can help the company know which air routes it needs to keep available, as well as how many resources to allocate for each mode.</li>
        </ul>
